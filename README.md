Scripts
=================
rom-build.sh - Modified version of the build script by Paranoid Android. Original version can be found at: https://github.com/ParanoidAndroid/paranoid

rmorig - Command used to remove all .orig files in the directory and it's subdirectories it is run from. I add this to path so I don't have to type the command everytime...
