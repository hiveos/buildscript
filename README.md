Scripts
=================
build.sh - Modified version of the build script by Paranoid Android. Original version can be found at: https://github.com/AOSPA/android_vendor_pa/blob/kitkat/build.sh

rmorig - Command used to remove all .orig files in the directory and it's subdirectories it is run from. I add this to path so I don't have to type the command everytime...
